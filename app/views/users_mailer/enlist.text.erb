So you've enlisted. Lovely. There are several things you need to know about how things work around here.

First, I'll be sending you orders. If you say you'll be in an operation, you'll receive a briefing on the day of the operation to remind you. You can set your notification options on your profile edit page:

<%= edit_user_url(@user) %>

Second, the Commanding Officer<% if User.officers.size > 1 %>s of your unit are: <% else %> of your unit is:<% end %>

<% User.officers.each do |officer| %>
   <%=officer.name%>: <%=officer.email%>, acting rank: <%= officer.rank == 4 ? 'Major' : 'Lieutenant' %>
<% end %>
  
They have the power to give you a dishonerable discharge and to reinstate you if you've been wrongly discharged. They also have the power to promote you to Sergeant, and the Majors can promote you up to Lieutenant.

Third, you won't be able to edit or delete the intel submitted by other recruits unless you are promoted to at least Sergeant. If you want that privilege, I suggest you start kissing your CO's ass now.

Any questions? Ask a CO, or look here:

<%= help_url %>

Now move out!
